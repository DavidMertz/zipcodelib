Some data cannot be easily obtained in an automated way.  Those
sources are placed in this directory and may not be straightforward
to fully replicate.

US Census filters
-----------------

Data was obtained from the US Census Bureau, starting at:

    https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/

This site requires selection and navigation of table features
within a web browser, and does not provide a RESTful interface in
any obvious way.

The row index in the main data file here is "5-Digit ZIP code
Tabulation Area" (ZCTA) which is not identical with zip code.  It
uses the same 5 digits, but the boundaries are only approximately
the same.  Information about ZCTAs can be found at: 

    https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_zcta.html

In general, even though some home address zip codes will not fall
within the ZCTA named the same, they will be adjacent, and most
likely demographically similar.  The file `DEC_10_DP_DPDP1.zip` is
not retained in this repository, but consists of the following 4
files that are contained herein:

    DEC_10_DP_DPDP1.txt:
        methodological notes on field meanings
    DEC_10_DP_DPDP1_metadata.csv:
        a detailed description of fields in archive
    DEC_10_DP_DPDP1_with_ann.csv:
        the main data file
    aff_download_readme_ann.txt:
        a description of the archive and these files

The plugin `datasets/load_housholds.py` imports the raw data
file from the US census, but discards a large number of the columns
within the full downloaded source.
